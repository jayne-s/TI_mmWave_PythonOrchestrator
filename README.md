# TI mmWave Studio Python Orchestrator

## Overview

This project establishes a proof-of-concept for remotely controlling a Texas Instruments mmWave radar from a separate machine without manually interacting with the mmWave Studio GUI. mmWave Studio is the standard TI software for configuring and capturing data from radars like the IWR6843ISK-ODS + DCA1000 EVM (using mmWave Studio version 2.1.1.0). By default, it requires manual GUI interaction. For automated or multi-radar deployments, this does not scale. TI ships a scripting framework called RSTD (Remote Studio Test Driver) that enables programmatic control of Studio via Lua scripts and a TCP-based remote interface.

## Goal

Build a working RSTD setup where:

* A radar laptop runs mmWave Studio with RSTD enabled and a connected IWR6843ISK-ODS + DCA1000 EVM
* A master machine connects over the network and executes a complete radar capture cycle programmatically: configuring the radar, starting a capture, and collecting the resulting UDP data packets (all without touching the GUI)

Captured data is forwarded via UDP packets through a packet sniffer and stored in MinIO for downstream processing. This architecture is designed to extend naturally to multiple simultaneous radars, although that is currently out of scope and has not been tested yet.

## Installation

a) Client Setup

* Install [.NET 8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)
* ```pip install paramiko python-dotenv```
* ```dotnet new console -n RadarRemote``` & add files in RadarRemote folder
* Adjust IP Address in Program.cs & Adjust Path to read_adc.py in radar_control.py
* Create .env file with HOSTNAME, USERNAME, PASSWORD variables

b) Host Setup

* Install [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/)
* Create .env file with MINIO_ROOT_USER, MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD, DEVICE_ID, INTERFACE, IP variables
* Docker Commands: ```docker compose up -d``` and ```docker compose stop```
* Create bucket called 'radar-data' using MinIO GUI (MinIO URL: ```http://localhost:9001```)
* ```pip install scapy minio python-dotenv```
* ```mkdir C:\RadarTemp```
* Use Windows Defender Firewall to create Inbound Rules for Ports 22 (SSH) and 2777 (RSTD)
* Install OpenSSH Server via Windows PowerShell (Run as Admin):
  ```
  a) Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Server~~~~0.0.1.0
  b) Get-WindowsCapability -Online | Where-Object Name -like 'OpenSSH.Server*' (to verify installation)
  c) Start-Service sshd
  d) Set-Service -Name sshd -StartupType Automatic (to enable on boot)
  e) Get-NetFirewallRule -Name *SSH* (to verify whether windows firewall allows it)
  ```

## Usage

Run ```python radar_control.py``` on the Client side.
